GEOS-RS -- Geometry Engine, Open Source in Rust
====================================

GEOS-RS is a Rust library for performing operations on two-dimensional vector
geometries. It is primarily a port of the [JTS Topology
Suite](https://github.com/locationtech/jts) Java library.  It provides many of
the algorithms used by [PostGIS](http://www.postgis.net/), the
[Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/) package for Python, the
[sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) package for R, and others.

The official Git repository is at [GitHub](https://github.com/UltimateThread/geos-rs).
